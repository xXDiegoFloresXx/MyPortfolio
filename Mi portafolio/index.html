    										<h3>FIRST Robotics Competition 2019</h3>
  										</header>
											<div class="description">
												Designed and built a competitive robot for the 2019 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). 
												As part of a highly motivated team, I played a crucial role in the mechanical design 
												and CAD modeling of the robot, while also considering the integration of electronic
												components for effective cable management and layout planning. My responsibilities 
												included developing design concepts, collaborating with teammates on CAD work, and 
												ensuring that our designs accommodated the necessary sensors, actuators, and wiring 
												requirements. Additionally, I contributed to the assembly and testing phases, gaining 
												valuable hands-on experience in iterative design, teamwork, and engineering problem-solving.

    										<h3>FIRST Robotics Competition 2020</h3>
  										</header>
											<div class="description">
												Participated in the 2020 edition of the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), where we focused
												 on refining our mechanical design and CAD modeling skills to create a robot capable of handling 
												 complex autonomous and teleoperated tasks. I contributed to the team by working on the CAD design, 
												 collaborating with teammates to optimize the robot’s structure and layout, and ensuring proper cable 
												 management for reliable performance. In addition to my design responsibilities, I also served as the 
												 primary driver of the robot during the competition, helping to implement our strategies on the field 
												 and ensuring smooth operation during matches. <br /><br />

    										<h3>John Deere's fixture</h3>
  										</header>
											<div class="description">
												Collaborated with John Deere on an engineering project focused on 
												designing and building a custom fixture specifically for bending metal 
												plates. Throughout this project, I worked closely with engineers and 
												manufacturing specialists to ensure the fixture met stringent performance 
												and quality standards. This experience significantly enhanced my understanding 
												of precision manufacturing processes, including tolerances, material behaviors 
												during bending, and the importance of robust fixture design for repeatable, 
												high-quality outcomes. Additionally, I gained valuable insights into collaborative 
												engineering practices and how to integrate customer requirements into practical, 
												effective solutions.

    										<h3>Lightsaber from Star Wars</h3>
  										</header>
											<div class="description">
												As part of my personal development, I modeled a lightsaber using CAD 
												software to explore and practice advanced rendering techniques. This 
												project allowed me to refine my understanding of three-dimensional 
												design principles, while also deepening my skills in creating 
												photorealistic renders that accurately represent material properties 
												and lighting effects. Through iterative modeling and rendering, I 
												gained valuable experience in optimizing geometry for efficient 
												visualization and in selecting appropriate textures and finishes to 
												achieve the desired aesthetic impact.
